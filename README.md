# Valhacks 2019 - SmartCampusData Challenge

## Idea Description
Using data on temperature and CO2 from DTU Smart Campus it would be possible to estimate the number of people in the cantines around campus.
Based on this data a simple app could be build to show how busy each cantine is at the given moment "Busy", "Medium", "Low".
Also it would be possible to create a schedule like a bar chart for how busy each cantine is during the day.
For this we have worked on an app prototype "Smart Cantine"

## The Smart Cantine App
The app is created in Angular using the ionic 1 framework.
It is intended to be a mobile application, so to get the right feel when serving it locally run the browser in mobile view using F12 and choosing mobile design mode.
You need ionic installed to run the app https://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/guide/installation.html
To run the app open the project in the terminal and type 'ionic serve'.
